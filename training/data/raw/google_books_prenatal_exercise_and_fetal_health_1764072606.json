        "description": "This new SpringerBrief in Physiology explores the newest research findings on how exercise influences the fetus in utero and beyond. Physiology of Prenatal Exercise and Fetal Development reviews the current findings of how maternal exercise throughout gestation influences fetal development of key organ systems, and also encompasses the relationship between maternal activity level and fetal, birth, and neonatal effects. This information will help researchers and scientists better understand the physiological effects of exercise during pregnancy on offspring development.",

It will provide medical, sports, and fitness professionals both with the knowledge needed to allay undue fears regarding the consequences of exercising during pregnancy and with the practical expertise to offer optimal guidance on exercising to pregnant exercisers and athletes. Readers will find up-to-date evidence on the psychological, social, physiological, body composition, musculoskeletal, and biomechanical changes that occur during pregnancy and their implications for physical activity and exercise. Detailed descriptions are provided of the components of exercise testing and prescription for pregnant women, the current evidence-based and practice-oriented guidelines, and exercise selection and adaptation during pregnancy. Exercises specifically targeting musculoskeletal health are discussed separately, and a concluding chapter explains the nutritional requirements in pregnant women who exercise.",

To assist professionals concerned with improving the health of teenage mothers and their babies, this annotated bibliography was developed through public and private sector efforts. It is a guide to resources on topics related to nutrition and adolescent pregnancy. Divided into two major sections, the first lists selected articles and books that include psychological, psychosocial, and nutritional aspects of adolescent pregnancy as well as counseling and assessment techniques and model service programs. Abstracts of educational materials that include teaching tools for nutrition counseling, handouts, posters/films, and curricula/resource materials. Nutrition reference questionnaires and evaluation worksheets are included.",

Science and gender equality are, however, essential to ensure sustainable development as highlighted by UNESCO. In order to change traditional mindsets, gender equality must be promoted, stereotypes defeated, and girls and women should be encouraged to pursue STEM careers. Therefore, Frontiers in Psychiatry is proud to offer this platform to promote the work of women scientists, across all fields of Psychiatry. The work presented here highlights the diversity of research performed across the entire breadth of Psychiatry research and presents advances in theory, experiment, and methodology with applications to compelling problems.",
