Average weekly energy expenditure (MET hours per week and kilocalories per week) of exercise-specific activity was assessed during pregnancy using the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire. Fasting glucose and insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were assessed at baseline and 20, 28, and 36 weeks' gestation.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>RESULTS</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Of the women in the intervention group, 16 of 22 (73%) achieved more than 900 kcal/week of exercise-based activity at 28 weeks compared with 8 of 19 women in the control group (42%), P = 0.047.

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GSD) is defined as hyperglycemia of variable degree with onset or first recognition during pregnancy which does not meet the criteria of clinical diabetes mellitus (DM). The growing incidence of GSD is a global health problem, affecting from 9% to 12% of pregnancies worldwide. In this review, we focused on the key aspects of GSD prevention. Major risk factors of GSD development include family history, past medical history of GSD, fetal macrosomia in previous pregnancies, and obesity. At primary treatment, lifestyle interventions (e.g., change of the dietary pattern) may represent an efficient measure, and here we consider several types of diets and dietary supplements (e.g., myoinositol, folic acid, and probiotics) that might be useful to mitigate GSD. Physical activity and specialised psychological care during pregnancy planning, during the pregnancy and in the postpartum period has a number of positive effects. Adequate perception of GSD, which might be improved by psychotherapy, directly correlates with adherence to therapeutic and preventive measures. The complex of dietary interventions, increased physical activity, and psychological care can significantly reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n\t  <jats:p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) poses significant health concerns for women and their offspring, with implications that extend beyond pregnancy. While GDM often resolves postpartum, a diagnosis of GDM confers a greater risk of future type 2 diabetes (T2D) and other chronic illnesses. Furthermore, the intergenerational impact of GDM predisposes offspring to increased chronic disease risk. Despite the awareness of the short- and long-term consequences of GDM, translating this knowledge into prevention strategies remains challenging. Challenges arise from a lack of clarity among health professionals regarding roles and responsibilities in chronic disease prevention and women’s lack of awareness of the magnitude of associated health risks. These challenges are compounded by changes in the circumstances of new mothers as they adjust to balance the demands of infant and family care with their own needs. Insights into behaviour change strategies, coupled with advances in technology and digital healthcare delivery options, have presented new opportunities for diabetes prevention among women with a history of GDM. Additionally, there is growing recognition of the benefits of adopting an implementation science approach to intervention delivery, which seeks to enhance the effectiveness and scalability of interventions. Effective prevention of T2D following GDM requires a comprehensive person-centred approach that leverages technology, targeted interventions and implementation science methodologies to address the complex needs of this population. Through a multifaceted approach, it is possible to improve the long-term health outcomes of women with prior GDM.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a significant health concern for pregnant women, associated with various adverse outcomes for both the mother and the fetus. This systematic review consolidates the current understanding and research on GDM, focusing on its prevalence, prevention, and treatment strategies. The review aims to highlight key findings and areas for future research, emphasizing the need for high-quality, inclusive studies to substantiate the effectiveness of various interventions. The review discusses the pathophysiology of GDM, the impact of maternal and neonatal adverse effects, and the comparison of treatment options such as insulin and metformin. Additionally, the study examines lifestyle interventions, dietary supplementation, and the use of probiotics as preventive measures. Accurate prevalence estimates are essential for the effective allocation of health resources and the development of prevention and management policies to address the rising rates of GDM. This review underscores the importance of standardized diagnostic criteria and screening strategies to obtain accurate and comparable prevalence estimates, ultimately aiming to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes.</jats:p>",

Several factors\nincrease the risk of a pregnant woman developing gestational diabetes mellitus, and several interventions\nhave been tested for the prevention of GDM development. The most common pharmacological interventions\nthat have been assessed are metformin administration, probiotics administration, and vitamin D administration.\nHowever, no intervention appears to be universally superior to placebo/no intervention for the prevention of\nGDM. Administration of insulin is the preferred medication for treating hyperglycemia in gestational diabetes\nmellitus. Metformin and glyburide are not regarded as first-line agents, as both cross the placenta to the fetus.\nEven though there are sufficient data indicating that administration of metformin is safe and effective in women\nwith GDM, there are very limited data concerning the long-term effects of metformin on the offspring. Furthermore,\nglyburide should be used with caution, as it increases the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. Some studies also\nshow that it increases the risk of macrosomia. Overall, oral agents may be a therapeutic option in women\nwith GDM after a discussion of the known risks and the need for more long-term safety data in the offspring.\nThe present review aims to highlight the current scientific status regarding the prevention and treatment of\nGDM.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",
