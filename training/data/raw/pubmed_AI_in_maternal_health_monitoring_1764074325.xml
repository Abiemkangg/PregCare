Traditional monitoring methods such as cardiotocography (CTG) and ultrasound are effective but primarily limited to clinical settings, requiring specialized expertise and resources. The rise of wearable medical devices and artificial intelligence (AI) applications presents an opportunity to enhance fetal monitoring by enabling continuous, real-time data collection outside clinical environments. These technologies have the potential to improve fetal health and obstetric outcomes, particularly in resource-limited settings. This systematic review aims to evaluate the use of wearable devices for antenatal fetal monitoring and their impact on fetal and obstetric outcomes.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS AND ANALYSIS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This systematic review will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) framework. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science will be conducted to identify primary research studies investigating wearable devices designed for fetal monitoring during pregnancy. Studies will be included if they assess the effectiveness, accuracy, and clinical impact of wearable fetal monitoring devices. Primary outcomes will include markers of fetal well-being as well as neonatal and obstetric outcomes. Secondary outcomes will focus on patient experience and acceptability. Data extraction and quality assessment will be conducted independently by two reviewers using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A narrative synthesis will be performed to summarise the findings.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Ethical approval is not required since the study involves analysing published literature. The findings will be shared through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. This review will enhance the evidence base regarding the clinical utility of wearable fetal monitoring technologies and inform future research and device development.

At the moment, most monitoring is done in hospitals using machines that required trained staff and regular clinic visits. But new wearable devices &#x2013; like smart patches or belts &#x2013; could change that. These devices are small, portable, and can monitor the baby&#x2019;s wellbeing at home, making pregnancy care more accessible and less stressful for patients. In this study, we plan to carefully review all the scientific research that has tested these wearable fetal monitoring devices during pregnancy. We will look at how well these devices work, what health outcomes they affect, and how pregnant people feel about using them. We will include studies from around the world, across all types of healthcare settings, to get a full picture. By bringing together the evidence, we aim to understand whether these technologies could help improve care during pregnancy, especially in places where access to clinics is limited. This review will also help guide future research and design of pregnancy monitoring tools that are safe, effective, and acceptable to patients.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright: &#xa9; 2025 Ranaei-Zamani N et al.</CopyrightInformation></OtherAbstract><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Wearable devices</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">antenatal care</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">fetal monitoring</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">maternal health technology</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">pregnancy outcomes</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">remote health monitoring</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">systematic review</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>No competing interests were disclosed.</CoiStatement></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="accepted"><Year>2025</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>29</Day></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2025</Year><Month>11</Month><Day>24</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>39</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2025</Year><Month>11</Month><Day>24</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>38</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2025</Year><Month>11</Month><Day>24</Day><Hour>9</Hour><Minute>9</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>epublish</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">41281953</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pmc">PMC12635520</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.12688/wellcomeopenres.24335.2</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle><PubmedArticle><MedlineCitation Status="Publisher" Owner="NLM"><PMID Version="1">41275147</PMID><DateRevised><Year>2025</Year><Month>11</Month><Day>22</Day></DateRevised><Article PubModel="Print-Electronic"><Journal><ISSN IssnType="Electronic">1471-2431</ISSN><JournalIssue CitedMedium="Internet"><PubDate><Year>2025</Year><Month>Nov</Month><Day>22</Day></PubDate></JournalIssue><Title>BMC pediatrics</Title><ISOAbbreviation>BMC Pediatr</ISOAbbreviation></Journal><ArticleTitle>Long-term outcomes of children born with neural-tube defects in Botswana.</ArticleTitle><ELocationID EIdType="doi" ValidYN="Y">10.1186/s12887-025-06313-0</ELocationID><Abstract><AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Major congenital abnormalities (CAs) disproportionately impact low and middle-income countries. Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common major CAs in Botswana, but there has been no research to date on long-term outcomes of children with NTDs in Botswana.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">The Tsepamo study conducted prospective systematic birth outcomes surveillance at 8-18 hospitals in Botswana from August 2014-May 2023, capturing data on&#x2009;~&#x2009;70% of births in the country. Trained midwives performed surface examinations on all infants (liveborn and stillborn) and identified major CAs, including NTDs. After obtaining parental consent, research assistants photographed CAs. Through medical record review and semi-structured interviews, we followed-up major health outcomes among children with NTDs whose caregivers initially consented to a photograph.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Between August 2014 and May 2023, 261,441 deliveries were recorded in Tsepamo, including 178 infants (0.068%) with NTDs. Of infants with NTDs, 99 (55.6%) were stillborn or died before discharge from the hospital, and 79 (44.4%) were alive at discharge; of these, maternal consent to photograph the child's CA was obtained in 57 (72%), of whom 53 (93%) were reached for follow-up interview, and of these 48 (91%) had a final diagnosis of NTD (5 re-classified as non-NTD abnormalities). Follow-up occurred at a median age of 5&#xa0;years (6&#xa0;months- 9&#xa0;years). Twenty infants had died (at median age 5&#xa0;months), yielding a mortality rate of 42% among those with NTD and alive at initial discharge, and 67% mortality rate overall. Thirty-six infants had NTD closure surgery (25 still alive, 11 died), and 30 infants with NTDs developed hydrocephalus; of those, 26 had shunts inserted, 14 of whom had shunt-related complications. Among the 28 children alive at follow-up, 20 (71%) live with significant physical disabilities (most commonly mobility disability) and 10 (36%) live with intellectual/developmental disability.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">NTDs are a significant cause of early child mortality and disability in Botswana, but there are limited systems in place to support these children. Interventions that include close monitoring of infants with major NTDs after birth, earlier shunt placement and monitoring for shunt-related complications, and increased support for disability-related needs could improve survival and quality of life for children with NTDs in Botswana.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#xa9; 2025.

Integrated into a low-cost, edge-computing system co-designed with Indigenous midwives in rural Guatemala, our solution utilizes an Android phone for data acquisition and decision support. Retrospective analysis demonstrates the potential to detect fetal growth restriction, hypertension, and other pregnancy-related conditions using Doppler-based fetal cardiac signals. To ensure accurate assessments and provide immediate feedback, a real-time signal quality metric is essential. We analyzed two fetal Doppler datasets: 191 recordings, captured in rural Guatemala, for training and validation, and five captured in a German hospital (in Leipzig) for testing. The data were segmented into 3.75&#x2009;s intervals, and categorized into five quality levels: good, poor, radiofrequency interference, talking, and silent. A deep neural network was trained on these segments, achieving a micro <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow> </mml:math> score of 97.4% and a macro <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow> </mml:math> score of 94.2%, with 99.2% accuracy for 'Good' quality in the Guatemala dataset, based on five-fold cross-validation. For the Leipzig dataset, the <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow> </mml:math> score was 93.3% on 'Good' quality segments, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize across different datasets. By implementing the algorithm within an Android decision-support application in an mHealth framework, we have enabled real-time feedback during signal acquisition, improving data quality at the source. This scalable, edge mHealth solution offers significant potential to enhance maternal and fetal health monitoring in the Global South, contributing to global health efforts through the integration of mobile technology, AI, and healthcare.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

Despite its centrality, there is still no globally standardised tool to measure functional ability across five domains defined by WHO: meeting basic needs; learning, growing, and making decisions; mobility; building and maintaining relationships; and contributing to society. Current approaches remain fragmented, limiting efforts to monitor progress and support equitable policy action. This commentary outlines three strategic priorities for addressing this gap. First, a globally validated functional ability scale should be developed, grounded in the WHO's five-domain framework. This effort must begin with clarifying the concept of functional ability-moving beyond narrow biomedical definitions-to ensure conceptual consistency. Early efforts in China and Japan demonstrate the feasibility of operationalising domain-level constructs, though challenges remain in empirical alignment. Second, this scale must be embedded in WHO global ageing population surveysto ensure cross-country comparability and data coverage in high-low- and middle-income contexts. Third, the field must move towards personalised functional ability profiles, reflecting older adults' own values and goals. Innovations in AI and machine learning may support this transition. With only five years remaining in the Decade, finalising and implementing a standardised, person-centred measurement approach is urgent. Doing so would not only advance international monitoring but also help realise the vision of enabling older people everywhere to achieve healthy ageing.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#xa9; The Author(s) 2025.

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of predictive models incorporating placental biomarkers such as placental growth factor (PlGF), increasing early detection accuracy from 47% with traditional methods to as high as 75% in early gestation. Early identification enables timely interventions - including low-dose aspirin, increased monitoring, and planned delivery - that can significantly reduce adverse outcomes. While biomarker-based AI models require infrastructure investment, their integration into healthcare systems, particularly in resource-limited settings, offers substantial cost-effectiveness and the potential to reduce preventable deaths. Successful implementation depends on accurate data collection, workforce training, standardized biomarker assays, and ongoing model validation across diverse populations. Policymakers, clinicians, and global health stakeholders should prioritize phased adoption strategies, ethical oversight, and public-private collaboration to ensure equitable access and maximize the life-saving potential of AI-based PE prediction tools.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).
