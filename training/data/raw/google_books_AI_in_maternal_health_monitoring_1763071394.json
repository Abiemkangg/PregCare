        "description": "In the ever-evolving landscape of maternal healthcare, expectant mothers face a myriad of challenges, from pregnancy complications to postpartum care. Traditional approaches often fail to provide timely and personalized interventions, leading to suboptimal outcomes for both mother and child. The lack of practical tools and strategies to address these complexities underscores the pressing need for innovative solutions that can revolutionize maternal care. Modernizing Maternal Care With Digital Technologies leads the way, offering a comprehensive solution that harnesses the power of modern technology and soft computing techniques to foster environments that improve maternal patient outcomes. This pioneering book delves into the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics, and wearable devices in reshaping maternal care. The book presents a paradigm shift in how expectant mothers can be supported throughout their pregnancy journey by highlighting the significance of predictive modeling and real-time monitoring.",

Over the past few decades, this field has burgeoned into a critical area of study, garnering attention from various disciplines such as obstetrics, gynecology, midwifery, nursing, psychology, and psychiatry. Evidence-based practices have catalyzed improvements in various health domains, ranging from managing complex pregnancies to fostering natural labor progression, promoting breastfeeding, and nurturing early parenthood. In light of contemporary global challenges, environmental alterations emerge as predominant health concerns significantly amplifying the vulnerability of women and infants. Issues like climate change, indoor and outdoor air pollution, and emerging environmental pollutants have spurred substantial attention towards the interaction between the environment and maternal-child health. Adverse environmental exposures may directly affect the health of mothers and children, perpetuating intergenerational consequences. A nuanced understanding of these effects and mechanisms is essential to safeguard maternal and child health.",
