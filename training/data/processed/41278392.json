  "abstract": "To study contemporaneous pregnancy outcomes in women with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). We retrospectively studied maternal and perinatal outcomes in women with T1D, and their age and gravidity matched healthy controls (N=161 pairs) who were admitted to Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, for delivery from January 01, 2006, to December 31, 2020, and provided research authorization for access to medical records. Data were initially electronically retrieved with subsequent manual review. We assessed 13 maternal and 22 perinatal outcome variables in 161 women with T1D and 161 healthy women matched on relevant variables. The combined study population had a mean age of 29±5 years, basic metabolic index (BMI) of 27.5±6 kg/m Pregnancies with T1D continue to be associated with suboptimal glycemic control and higher maternal and perinatal morbidity, as compared to pregnancies in women without T1D, reinforcing the urgent need for the development of interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes.",
