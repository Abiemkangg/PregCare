  "title": "Postpartum Depression: Overview and Management",
  "abstract": "<jats:p>The mental health of a mother during her pregnancy has a significant impact on the mother, her child, and the family. Psychopathologies such as postpartum depression (PPD) are among the most common. Many women are reluctant to acknowledge their sadness to others after having a child. Postpartum hormone fluctuations may be the cause of the baby blues. PPD is characterized by symptoms of depression, such as ongoing melancholy, disinterest, low self-esteem, disturbed sleep, appetite loss, anxiety, impatience with a hostile attitude toward newborns, self-blame, and feelings of humiliation. There has been a lot published about the symptoms, risk factors, and therapies for PPD, but not much research has been done on why women wait so long to get therapy. Remission, or the resolution of depressive symptoms, is the aim of PPD treatment. It could be required to coordinate with therapists and refer patients to psychiatrists for antidepressant medication. A complete recovery depends on early discovery and treatment.</jats:p>",
