  "abstract": "Obesity in pregnant women increases offspring cardiovascular risk and causes fetal cardiac dysfunction. The underpinning mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesised that circulating factors in serum from fetuses of women with obesity induce pathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Pregnant women with obesity or healthy weight were recruited at term and provided umbilical cord serum and placentas, which were used for isolation of primary trophoblast cells. Primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from neonatal rats. Compared to cord serum from healthy weight women, cord serum from women with obesity upregulated cardiomyocyte mRNA expression of atrial natriuretic factor (",
