  "title": "Implementation Components of Diabetes Prevention Programs after Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Scoping Review.",
  "abstract": "To synthesize the components of diabetes prevention programs (DPPs) after gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and how they relate to factors that influence implementation. We conducted a scoping review of the literature using MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, and Emcare. We provided a narrative description of intervention components based on the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) and the study results based on the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Seventeen included studies described DPPs after GDM. Recruitment typically began during pregnancy, while interventions started postpartum, with higher reach and participation rates for studies that recruited during pregnancy. The included DPPs used face-to-face delivery, virtual delivery, or a combination. Many programs were individual, but a few had a group component. Program duration varied from one month to three years. The available data highlighted the need to increase engagement, particularly for minority groups, and utilize flexibility and tailoring of program components and delivery to optimize retention, impact and sustainability. Significant barriers to the successful implementation of DPPs after GDM exist; the reporting of intervention components and implementation outcomes in the existing studies is variable. Validated frameworks, including RE-AIM, should be integrated into intervention development, implementation and evaluation.",
