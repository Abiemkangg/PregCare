Average weekly energy expenditure (MET hours per week and kilocalories per week) of exercise-specific activity was assessed during pregnancy using the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire. Fasting glucose and insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were assessed at baseline and 20, 28, and 36 weeks' gestation.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>RESULTS</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Of the women in the intervention group, 16 of 22 (73%) achieved more than 900 kcal/week of exercise-based activity at 28 weeks compared with 8 of 19 women in the control group (42%), P = 0.047. However, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) did not differ between the groups.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>CONCLUSION</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This intervention was feasible and prompted a modest increase in physical activity. However, we are not confident that this intervention would be sufficient to prevent GDM.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",
