  "abstract": "Zinc deficiency remains a public health concern in South Asia but is rarely studied through gestation to infancy. We identified maternal and infant factors related to plasma zinc of 3 mo old Bangladeshi infants ( Mean ± SD infant plasma zinc was 15.63 ± 6.65 µmol/L, with 10.1% deficiency (<9.9 µmol/L). In adjusted analyses, infant zinc was positively associated with maternal age [20-30 years +0.11 µmol/L ( Thus, infant zinc was associated with pre- but not post-MMS maternal zinc, age and parity, feeding style, and infant iron status. Infant length but not weight was associated with plasma zinc.",
