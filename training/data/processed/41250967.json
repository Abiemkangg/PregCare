  "title": "An Interprofessional Approach to Teaching About Postpartum Depression.",
  "abstract": "Mental health conditions are the leading cause of pregnancy-related death in the United States. The purpose of this study was to explore the use of interprofessional simulation for postpartum depression management. Midwifery, women's health gender-related nurse practitioner, and psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner students participated in an interprofessional postpartum depression simulation. Full-time students enrolled at the university in 2024 and 2025 were eligible to participate in a study using a pre-posttest design. Attitudes toward and confidence in management of postpartum depression were assessed before and after the simulation using a modified version of the Revised Depression Attitude Questionnaire (R-DAQ). There was a significant increase in modified R-DAQ scores following the intervention. Students' comments showed that they found the experience positive and that it helped improve their interprofessional communication and confidence in the management of postpartum depression. This is the first known study assessing the efficacy of an interprofessional postpartum depression simulation. Limitations include a lack of longitudinal data, a single site, and the use of a modified rating scale. Interprofessional simulation can be an effective educational intervention to prepare advanced practice nursing students to manage postpartum depression.",
