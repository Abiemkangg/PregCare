  "abstract": "The transition period around calving is a vulnerable phase for dairy animals, often marked by negative energy balance (NEB), metabolic disorders, and suppressed milk production. This study evaluated the impact of targeted supplementation with a polyherbal-multimineral-multivitamin blend on the behavioural patterns, metabolic status, and postpartum performance of Murrah buffaloes. In this study, advanced pregnant Murrah buffaloes were screened on the basis of their blood β-hydroxybutyrate (mmol/L), non-esterified fatty acids (µmol/L) and glucose (mg/dl) levels to identify animals at risk of metabolic stress in pre-partum period. A total of 21 advanced pregnant buffaloes were divided into three groups: a healthy control (T0), a NEB-affected unsupplemented group (T",
