  "abstract": "To summarize recent updates in the treatment of postpartum bipolar disorder (PBD).PBD requires timely and comprehensive management, as childbirth is a period of elevated relapse risk in women with preexisting illness and may also mark first-onset presentations. Episodes can manifest as depression, mixed states, mania, or psychosis, with severe consequences for maternal safety, infant well being, and early bonding. Sleep loss around labor and postpartum further increases vulnerability. PBD demands a multifaceted therapeutic approach, with pharmacotherapy as the cornerstone. Lithium, lamotrigine, and selected second-generation antipsychotics remain key options, guided by efficacy, lactation safety, and individualized risk-benefit assessment. Structured relapse-prevention planning, sleep protection, and support for mother-infant bonding are crucial nonpharmacological elements. Early, targeted intervention reduces relapse and suicide risk while supporting maternal functioning and family stability. Beyond optimized pharmacological care, recent research highlights a treatment continuum spanning pregnancy and postpartum. Multidisciplinary collaboration across psychiatry, obstetrics, and neonatal care is crucial to ensure maternal safety, optimize infant outcomes, and support families. Integrating lived experience and patient collaboration enhances relevance. A life-course perspective across reproduction, combining biological and psychosocial insights, signals a shift toward holistic, personalized, precision-based strategies in managing PBD.",
