  "abstract": "<jats:p> Government guidelines stress the need for pregnant women to have a balanced diet and to take certain vitamins and minerals. Midwives have a role in promoting healthy eating during pregnancy, particularly as pregnant women are faced with constant media messages about a healthy diet. Many women who have babies with a low birth weight are from low income backgrounds and are unable to provide themselves with an adequate diet. It is well documented that babies born underweight are more likely to suffer from illnesses and disabilities. Folic acid is an essential supplement for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy as it is proven to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects in babies. Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are fast becoming recognized as an important supplement for mothers, to ensure good brain development in the baby and a longer gestation period which increases birth weight. </jats:p>",
